Hi all. I'm Una Karlsen. Some may know me as Pi Delport's partner. 

I've been a member of The South Yeasters home brew club for about a year and a half now. My main interest in fermentation came from Mead. Some years back I encountered my first bottle of mead and loved the stuff. Unfortunately, that producer is no more and I haven't been impressed with most of the commercially available mead in South Africa, if you can find it at all. My brother has been home brewing for probably 15 years or so. What started as an experiment to make alcohol to make rocket fuel, for him turned into a passion for making rum and whiskey. Since he is also a beekeeper, I tried to convince him to make mead for me, but he declined so I decided to try it for myself. It turned out to be fun and I was able to make something that I enjoyed and my friends liked too. Pi and I joined the home brew club which started a journey of learning everything we could about brewing the beverages that we enjoy. 

Thanks to meeting the local brewing community I found that there are actually types of beer that I like. It just turns out that I don't like bitter beers and that I prefer fruity and/or sour ones. We made a braggot and inspired others to do the same. I've made some kombucha and I look forward to experimenting with making my own gruits, ciders and sour/fruit beers in future.

I am a maker and tinkerer of many stripes with skills ranging from electronics to programming to woodwork and leatherwork. Therefore, I have some automation and monitoring systems for our home brewing setup in progress on the workbench. There is also a Kegerator planned for later this year. I've worked in the IT industry for the past 20 years but I'm about to take a break from that to study cinematography and document my various hobbies and pursuits on YouTube. Like Pi, I am also an amateur radio operator, ZS1UNA.
